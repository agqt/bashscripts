# x264tox265 (bash)
Bash script for automated conversions of all x264 files in a directory to an x265 .mp4 file in a new subdirectory, with standard compression.

Experimentally has reduced x264 file sizes down to 7-25% of the original size

Useful for reduction of file sizes with image/video analysis of long term experiments recorded in an outdated codec, such as x264.
